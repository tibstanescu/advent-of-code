Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
Please check out the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website for more information.

This repository contains my solutions to the puzzles, along with a specific challenge each year.

For year 2023, I will solve each puzzle in JS in a chained functional style - no loops, no mutation, ~~no~~ few side effects, few variables/constants.

Due to copyright, I will not be publishing the problems themselves, or the inputs.

=== SOON ===

Use a script to generate the problems folder automatically.
